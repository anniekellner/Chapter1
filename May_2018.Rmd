```{r echo=FALSE} 
rm(list = ls())
land <- read.csv("Land.csv")
```
#All land

83 unique individuals use land from 2004-2016. If all months are included, all years are represented.  

Number of data points per animal, per year (all months included):

```{r echo=FALSE} 
table(land$animal, land$year)
```

#Open Water Season, defined as July - October
Years without data: 2007, 2010, 2016

```{r echo=FALSE}
ows <- subset(land, land$month > 6 & land$month < 11)
table(ows$animal, ows$year)
```

Questions:   
* How little data is too little? e.g., 14 points? 15 points? Should these be deleted or included?  
* Should I divide by year for easier analysis?

Total number data points 'all land'| Total number data points 'OWS'

`r nrow(land)`                     | `r nrow(ows)`

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
